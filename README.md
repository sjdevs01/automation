# ðŸ¤– Automation
A simple JavaScript script to automate your classes.

## ðŸš€ How to get it working?
- First, install NodeJS.
- Next, clone the repository to a local folder and cd into it.
- Next, run `npm i` to install the required dependencies.
- Next, download the webdriver from https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/chromedriver/downloads by selecting the driver matching your browser version. Then place it in `C:\Windows` or search for a guide for your operating system.
- Next, update the credentials for your google account in `creds.js` file and update the routine object and links object in `index.js` matching your routine. (If you are from my class, then you need not update it)
- You are good to go! Next time when you want to automate your classes, you can just run `node index.js` **or** run the `init.bat` file.

I know this isnt the most convinient way to automate your classes but it was made in the last month of our session so I don't think it makes much sense to use it either ways and so didn't put a lot of effort in the usability/UX of the thing. Its just a makeshift, so use it if you desire :)
